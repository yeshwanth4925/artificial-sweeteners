<h1>Manufacturing Process</h1>
Artificial sweeteners are synthesized through chemical reactions:
<br>
Aspartame is made by combining aspartic acid and phenylalanine.
<br>
Saccharin is produced from toluene derivatives.
<br>
Sucralose is derived from sucrose by replacing hydroxyl groups with chlorine atoms.
<br>
Acesulfame Potassium is synthesized using acetoacetic acid and potassium.
<br>
Neotame is created by modifying aspartame for enhanced sweetness.
<br>
<h1>Advantages</h1>
Low-calorie alternative for weight management.
<br>
Suitable for diabetics as they don’t raise blood sugar levels.
<br>
Long shelf life compared to natural sugar.
<br>
